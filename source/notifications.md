# Notifications

If you want to keep yourself up-to-date and see who gets some OG-counts such as 1337, 420 etc. you can add a notification using `c!notifyme 1337`.

If you want to get norified on 1000, 2000, 3000 etc. you don't need to add another notification for every 1000, just use `c!notifyme each 1000`.

If you want a list of your notifications, you can do `c!notifs`.

If you want to remove a notification, you can do `c!removenotif <ID>` - The ID can be found in `c!notifs`.

Fun fact: The ID is a 6-character base64-string, so you can literally have 68 billion, 719 million, 476 thousand and 736 notifications in each guild. Why do you ask? I have literally no clue, but it looks pretty.
