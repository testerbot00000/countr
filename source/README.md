# Countr

**Countr** is a simple counting bot which can manage a counting channel for your guild. There is a lot of multi-purpose bots out there, some of them may also include a simple counting setup. Countr is not multi-purpose, it's only focused on counting. This means Countr has much more counting channel features than other bots. Countr has a simple setup but also has cool advanced features, such as modules, rewards and more.
