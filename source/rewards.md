# Counting Rewards

If you want to go a little more advanced in your server, you can give them rewards :)

### Role Rewards

Role Rewards are roles that you can reward users for typing whatever count you want. The most common usage is a "counting champion"-role that gets rewarded each 1000th count.

To set this up, you can do this: `c!addrole Counting_champ! each 1000 temporary`. Of course you can do it however you want, so go to [Staff Commands](staffcommands.html) for more information.

If you want a list of the servers' role rewards, you can do `c!roles`.

If you want to remove a role reward, you can do `c!removerole <ID>` - The ID can be found in `c!roles`.

Fun fact: The ID is a 6-character base64-string, so you can literally have 68 billion, 719 million, 476 thousand and 736 roles in your guild. Why do you ask? I have literally no clue, but it looks pretty.
