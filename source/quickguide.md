# Quick Setup Guide

Setting up Countr is easy, just follow these three steps:

1. Add the bot using [this](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=467377486141980682&permissions=11280&scope=bot) link.
2. Make a channel (for example #counting-channel) or use an existing channel.
3. Type `c!link` in the channel you got in step 2.

### Self-hosting

The source for Countr is public. When I (Promise#0001) made Countr, I was also not experienced using discord.js at all. The main reason for the bot being public is so users can have a blast and learn how to make something fun. I felt a project like this would be fun - and it was. Thank you for the support so far.

Back to self-hosting. The source can be found [here](https://github.com/gleeny/countr/). We do not recommend hosting it yourself, therefore we will not give you support if you self-host it. A tutorial is on the GitHub-page, that's all help we can give you.

Due to our [LICENSE](https://github.com/gleeny/countr/blob/master/LICENSE), you will have to document what you change in your code if you decide to have the source public.
